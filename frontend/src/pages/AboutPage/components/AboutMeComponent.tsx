                  My passion is in dissecting complex problems and architecting elegant, efficient solutions. This drive is rooted in a deep command of Data Structures and Algorithms, a skill I continuously sharpen on platforms like LeETCode. I channel this analytical expertise into building complete web applications, where I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean code and thoughtful design. With hands-on project experience in full-stack development, I am looking for a challenging role where my core problem-solving abilities can make a significant impact.
